# FarmManagement

## Overview
FarmManagement is an emerging mobile application crafted with React Native, aimed at aiding agricultural operations. Currently in the initial phase of development, this app provides a foundational framework for what will become a robust tool for farm management. The app supports both iOS and Android devices, offering a practical solution for farmers and agricultural managers to monitor and manage their operations more effectively.

## Purpose
The purpose of FarmManagement is to develop into a comprehensive application that supports various aspects of farm management. While still in the early stages of development, the eventual goal is to enable farmers to:
- Monitor real-time weather conditions to make informed decisions about planting and harvesting.
- Track and manage farm locations and boundaries using advanced geolocation services.
- Navigate through different functionalities of the app with ease, enhancing user interaction and efficiency.

## Technologies Used
- **React Native**: Utilized for cross-platform mobile application development, enabling the use of a single JavaScript codebase to create a native mobile experience.
- **Location Services and Weather APIs**: Planned integration for future development to provide location tracking and live weather updates.

## Ongoing Development
FarmManagement is actively under development. The project is currently focused on establishing core features that lay the groundwork for more complex functionalities. Future updates aim to introduce comprehensive tools for crop management, resource allocation, and decision-making support based on predictive analytics.
